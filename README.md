# ❄️ Whiteout Survival Autopilot (WOS-Bot)

A high-performance, intelligent automation suite for **Whiteout Survival**, built with Python, OpenCV, and PaddleOCR. This bot is designed for efficiency, utilizing a local OCR server and high-speed screen streaming via `scrcpy` and `v4l2loopback`.

> **Note:** High-speed streaming mode is optimized for **Linux** environments. Windows users may fall back to standard ADB screen capture.

## 🧠 The Bot Brain: How it Works
The bot operates on a **Research -> Strategy -> Execution** loop:
1.  **Vision Engine:** Instead of simple coordinate clicking, the bot "sees" the game using a hybrid approach of **PaddleOCR** (for reading text) and **OpenCV Template Matching** (for identifying icons).
2.  **Fuzzy Logic:** Uses `rapidfuzz` to handle OCR misreads (e.g., reading '0' as 'O'), ensuring actions don't fail due to tiny text variations.
3.  **Local OCR Server:** A dedicated FastAPI server handles heavy lifting for image processing, allowing the main bot logic to remain lightweight and fast.
4.  **FSM (Finite State Machine):** (In development) A navigation graph that allows the bot to calculate the shortest path between game screens (e.g., jumping from "World Map" directly to "Alliance Tech").

## 🚨 ATTENTION: RESOLUTION LOCK 🚨

> [!CAUTION]
> **THIS BOT IS HARDCODED FOR 1080x2460 RESOLUTION.**
> 
> If your device/emulator is set to **ANY OTHER** resolution or aspect ratio:
> 1.  **ROI Detection will FAIL.**
> 2.  **Clicks will land in the WRONG locations.**
> 3.  **The bot will get lost and may perform unintended actions.**

### 🛠️ The Fix (In Progress)
We are developing an **Auto-Calibration Suite**. In a future update, the bot will automatically detect your resolution on the first run, perform a "World Tour" of all game screens, and dynamically rewrite the reference coordinates in `references/TextArea` to match your device.

## 🚀 Quickstart (Arch Linux)

### 1. System Dependencies
Install the required tools for high-speed screen mirroring:
```bash
sudo pacman -Syu scrcpy v4l2loopback-dkms v4l2loopback-utils android-tools uv
```

### 2. Setup V4L2 Loopback
To enable the high-speed stream into the OCR engine, you must initialize the virtual video device (Recommended). If the device is not initialized then the ocr program will handle this specifically:
```bash
sudo modprobe v4l2loopback video_nr=10 card_label="scrcpy" exclusive_caps=1
```

### 3. Starting the OCR server
We use `uv` for lightning-fast dependency management, This will install dependancy and run the server:
```bash
cd wos
uv run core/ocr.py
```

### Run the Bot
Run this in a separate terminal window, to start the bot. Make sure you are in a known terminal. If the WOS app is not opened, the bot will open the application automatically.gi
```bash
python Main/main.py
```

## 🛠️ Features & Use Cases
The bot is feature-complete for daily maintenance tasks:

*   **Gathering:** Intelligent resource search (Meat/Wood/Coal/Iron) with troop equalization and recall logic.
*   **Alliance Management:** Auto-contribute to Tech, help all members, collect alliance chests, and auto-join rallies.
*   **Intel Missions:** Automatically completes Beast hunts, Survivor rescues, and Exploration intel.
*   **Hero Growth:** Daily training of Infantry, Lancers, and Marksmen.
*   **Rewards:** Automated collection of VIP rewards, Mail, Missions, and Life Essence.
*   **Competitive:** Automated Arena battles and Labyrinth runs.
